Python code to implement a recommendation system using machine learning

This repository contains a sample code in Python to implement a recommendation system using machine learning. The code uses the cosine similarity between items to make recommendations based on the user's past ratings. The code loads the dataset, creates a pivot table with users as rows and items as columns, computes the cosine similarity between all items, and creates a dataframe with the similarity scores. The code uses these scores to make predictions for each user-item combination and calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the model.

# Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
# Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the code using python recommendation_system.py
# Dataset
The code uses a sample ratings dataset in CSV format. The file should contain columns for user_id, item_id, and rating. The sample code assumes the file is named ratings.csv and is located in the same directory as the code. You can replace the file with your own dataset or modify the code to load the data from a different location.

# Results
The code outputs the RMSE value, which measures the accuracy of the predictions. A lower RMSE value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

# Limitations
This code is meant to serve as a sample and should not be used in production without proper testing and validation. The code has not been optimized for performance and may not be suitable for large datasets.
